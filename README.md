# Create your Own chatbot - TensorFlow-Based Chatbot Deployment in Python

Welcome to the **TensorFlow-Based Chatbot Deployment in Python** project! This repository contains everything you need to build, train, and deploy a chatbot using TensorFlow. Whether you're an AI enthusiast, developer, or someone new to machine learning, this guide will help you understand the process step by step.

## Project Overview

This project demonstrates how to create a fully functional chatbot using TensorFlow and Python. The chatbot is designed to handle simple queries and provide responses based on predefined intents. It uses natural language processing (NLP) techniques to understand user inputs and deliver appropriate answers.

## Key Features

- **User-Friendly Interaction**: The chatbot engages users with friendly and relevant responses.
- **Machine Learning Powered**: Leverages TensorFlow to train the chatbot on a dataset of intents and responses.
- **Easy Deployment**: The codebase is designed to be easily deployed on various platforms, including local machines and cloud services.
- **Extensive Documentation**: Detailed comments and documentation make it easy to understand and modify the code.

## How It Works

1. **Data Preparation**: 
    - The chatbot is trained on a dataset of intents and responses provided in the `intents.json` file.
    - This dataset includes various user inputs categorized into different tags or "intents" and the appropriate responses for each tag.

2. **Model Training**:
    - Using TensorFlow, the data is processed, and a neural network model is trained.
    - The model learns to predict the intent of a user's input and select the correct response.

3. **Model Deployment**:
    - Once trained, the model can be used to interact with users in real-time.
    - The deployment script allows you to run the chatbot either locally or on a server.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

- **Python 3.x**
- **TensorFlow**
- **NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit)**

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/TravelXML/TensorFlow-Based-Chatbot-Deployment-in-Python.git
   cd TensorFlow-Based-Chatbot-Deployment-in-Python
   ```

2. Install the required dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Run the training script to build the model:

   ```bash
   python train.py
   ```

4. Start the chatbot:

   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

### Usage

- **Training the Model**: Modify the `intents.json` file with your custom data and retrain the model using `train.py`.
- **Interacting with the Bot**: Once the model is trained, you can interact with the bot using `main.py`.

### Example Interaction

Here's an example of how the chatbot might respond:

```plaintext
User: Hi!
Bot: Hello! How can I help you today?
```

## File Structure

- `intents.json`: Contains the training data for the chatbot.
- `train.py`: Script for training the model.
- `main.py`: Script to deploy the chatbot and interact with users.
- `chatbot_model.h5`: The trained TensorFlow model.
- `requirements.txt`: List of dependencies required to run the project.

## Troubleshooting

- **Model Not Found**: Ensure that `chatbot_model.h5` is generated after training and is present in the project directory.
- **No Response from Bot**: Check if the model is correctly loaded and the `intents.json` file is properly formatted.
